Commodity Market & Regional Economy Dashboard
The platform combines two key functions:

Commodity Market Dynamics: A dashboard that visualizes and explains the trends, profitability, and risks of trading specific commodities (e.g., rice, gold, wheat, crude oil).
Regional Economic Insights: A tool for analyzing how these commodities impact regional economies, including employment, trade, and sector growth.
This dashboard would serve economists, policymakers, traders, and students, providing insights into the economic and market forces shaping commodity-driven economies.
